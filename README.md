# Welcome to HAL! <a name="introduction"></a>

HAL \[/hel/\] is a comprehensive netlist reverse engineering and manipulation framework.

## What the hell is HAL?
Virtually all available research on netlist analysis operates on a graph-based representation of the netlist under inspection.
At its core, HAL provides exactly that: A framework to parse netlists of arbitrary sources, e.g., FPGAs or ASICs, into a graph-based netlist representation and to provide the necessary built-in tools for traversal and analysis of the included gates and nets.

Our vision is that HAL becomes the hardware-reverse-engineering-equivalent of tools like IDA or Ghidra.
We want HAL to enable a common baseline for researchers and analysts to improve reproducibility of research results and abstract away recurring basic tasks such as netlist parsing etc.
- **High performance** thanks to the optimized C++ core
- **Flexibility** through built-in Python bindings
- **Modularity** via a C++ plugin system
- **Stability** is ensured via a rich test suite

HAL is actively developed by the Embedded Security group of the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org).
Apart from multiple research projects, it is also used in our university lecture [Introduction to Hardware Reverse Engineering](https://www.ei.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/studium/lehrveranstaltungen/832/).

Note that we also have a set of **modern** state-of-the-art benchmark circuits for the evaluation of netlist reverse engineering techniques available in a seperate [repository](https://github.com/emsec/hal-benchmarks).

## Shipped Plugins
This repository contains a selection of curated plugins:
- **GUI:** A feature-rich GUI allowing for visual netlist inspection and interactive analysis
  - Native integration of a Python shell with access to the HAL Python bindings
  - Isolation of specific gates or modules for clutter-free inspection
  - Interactive traversal of netlists
  - Detailed widgets with information on all aspects of the inspected netlist
- **Netlist Simulator:** A simulator for arbitrary parts of a loaded netlist
- **Dataflow Analysis:** Our dataflow analysis plugin [DANA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/751.pdf) that recovers high-level registers in an unstructured netlist
- **Graph Algorithms:** [igraph](https://igraph.org) integration for direct access to common algorithms from graph-theory
- **Python Shell:** A command-line plugin to spawn a Python shell preloaded with the HAL Python bindings
- **VHDL & Verilog Parsers:** Adds support for parsing VHDL and Verilog files as netlist input formats
- **Liberty Parser:** Adds support for arbitrary gate libraries in the standard `liberty` gate library format
- **VHDL & Verilog Writers:** Adds support for serializing a (modified) netlist to synthesizable VHDL or Verilog files
- **Gate Libraries:** Adds support for the XILINX Unisim and Simprim gate libraries


## API Documentation
The C++ documentation is available [here](https://emsec.github.io/hal/doc/).
The Python documentation can be found [here](https://emsec.github.io/hal/pydoc/).

# Install Instructions <a name="install-instructions"></a>

## Ubuntu

HAL releases are available via it's own ppa, which can be found here: [ppa:sebastian-wallat/hal](https://launchpad.net/~sebastian-wallat/+archive/ubuntu/hal)

## macOS

Use the following commands to install hal via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_de).

```bash
brew tap emsec/hal
brew install hal
```

# Build Instructions <a name="build-instructions"></a>

If you want to build HAL locally on your machine, run the following commands:

1. `git clone https://github.com/emsec/hal.git && cd hal`
2. To install all neccessary dependencies execute `./install_dependencies.sh`
3. `mkdir build && cd build`
4. `cmake .. ` + your desired configuration (see below)
5. `make`
6. `make install` (optionally)

## CMake Options
Using the CMake build system, your HAL build can be configured quite easily (by adding `-D<OPTION>=1` to the cmake command).
Here is a selection of the most important options:
- `BUILD_TESTS`: builds all available tests which can be executed by running `ctest` in the build directory.
This also builds all tests of plugins that are built.
- `BUILD_DOCUMENTATION`: build the C++ and Python documentation
- `PL_<plugin name>`: enable (or disable) building a specific plugin
- `BUILD_ALL_PLUGINS`: all-in-one option to build all available plugins, overrides the options for individual plugins
- `SANITIZE_ADDRESS`, `SANITIZE_MEMORY`, `SANITIZE_THREAD`, `SANITIZE_UNDEFINED `: builds with the respective sanitizers (recommended only for debug builds)

The default `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` if you do not specify any option is set to `Release`.

## Notes for building on macOS

Please make sure to use a compiler that supports OpenMP. You can install one using, e.g., Homebrew via: `brew install llvm`.

To let cmake know of the custom compiler use following command.

`cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++`


# Quickstart Guide <a name="quickstart"></a>

Install HAL or build HAL and start the GUI via `hal -g`. You can list all available options via `hal [--help|-h]`.
We included some example netlists in `examples` together with the implementation of the respective example gate library in `plugins/example_gate_library`.
For instructions to create your own gate library and other useful tutorials, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/emsec/hal/wiki).

Load a library from the `examples` directory and start exploring the graphical representation.
Use the integrated Python shell or the Python script window to interact. Both feature (limited) autocomplete functionality.

Let's list all lookup tables and print their Boolean functions:
```python
for gate in netlist.get_gates():
    if "LUT" in gate.type.name:
        print("{} (id {}, type {})".format(gate.name, gate.id, gate.type.name))
        print("  {}-to-{} LUT".format(len(gate.input_pins), len(gate.output_pins)))
        boolean_functions = gate.boolean_functions
        for name in boolean_functions:
            print("  {}: {}".format(name, boolean_functions[name]))
        print("")
```
For the example netlist `fsm.vhd` this prints:
```text
FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_0_i_3_inst (id 4, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (!I1 & !I2 & I3 & !I4 & I5) | (I0 & !I2) | (I0 & I1) | (I0 & I3) | (I0 & I4) | (I0 & I5)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_0_i_2_inst (id 3, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (I2 & I3 & I4 & !I5) | (I1 & !I5) | (I1 & !I4) | (I1 & !I3) | (I0 & I1) | (I1 & I2)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_1_i_3_inst (id 6, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (!I1 & I4 & !I5) | (!I1 & !I3 & I4) | (I0 & I4 & !I5) | (I0 & !I3 & I4) | (!I1 & I2 & I4) | (I0 & I2 & I4) | (!I2 & !I5) | (!I2 & !I4) | (!I2 & !I3) | (!I0 & !I4) | (!I0 & !I2) | (!I0 & !I1) | (I1 & !I4) | (I1 & !I2) | (I0 & I1) | (I3 & !I5) | (I3 & !I4) | (!I0 & I3) | (I1 & I3) | (I2 & I3) | (!I4 & I5) | (!I3 & I5) | (!I0 & I5) | (I1 & I5) | (I2 & I5)

FSM_sequential_STATE_REG_1_i_2_inst (id 5, type LUT6)
  6-to-1 LUT
  O: (!I0 & I1 & !I2 & I3 & I4 & !I5) | (I0 & !I2 & I3 & I4 & I5)

OUTPUT_BUF_0_inst_i_1_inst (id 18, type LUT1)
  1-to-1 LUT
  O: !I0

OUTPUT_BUF_1_inst_i_1_inst (id 20, type LUT2)
  2-to-1 LUT
  O: (I0 & !I1) | (!I0 & I1)
```
